    <p>Once upon a time in the world of Fortnite, there was a teacher known across all the POIs—Miloslurp Sniper. He was
        a strict, no-nonsense educator who taught at the Tilted Towers Academy, a school nestled between towering
        buildings and dangerous zones. Miloslurp Sniper didn’t just hand out lessons; he delivered them with the same
        precision as his favorite weapon, the Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle. If you missed a question, it felt like you took
        damage straight to your shield.
        <br>
        Now, in Miloslurp's class, there was one student who seemed determined to troll his way through the
        semester—Jonesy Janas. Jonesy had skills in the battle royale, no doubt about it. He could build a 1x1 faster
        than anyone, glide into Victory Royales with ease, and even crank 90s like it was his job. But in class? Well,
        let’s just say he was more interested in emoting than equations.
        <br>
        Miloslurp had a reputation for being tough, but even he had a soft spot for students who tried. Jonesy? He spent
        his days in the back of the classroom, pulling off L-dance emotes and thinking he could just respawn into the
        next grade. Homework? Never turned in. Tests? Dodged them like a pro in a sniper showdown. Miloslurp had given
        him chance after chance, but it seemed like Jonesy had mats to waste.
        <br>
        The final day of the semester arrived. The storm circle was closing in, and the class was on their final
        exam—the last chance for anyone to level up to the next grade. Jonesy Janas strolled into the classroom late,
        throwing down a Chug Jug as if that would get him through the test. Miloslurp stood at the front, eyes sharp
        like he had his sights on a headshot.
        <br>
        “You really think you can just glide your way out of this, Janas?” Miloslurp asked, tapping the test with his
        tactical pencil.
        <br>
        Jonesy shrugged, confident as ever. “It’s just another drop. I’ll build my way through it.”
        But Miloslurp wasn’t having it this time. He activated his classroom trap card—an essay on the lore of the
        Seven, something Jonesy hadn’t paid attention to all year. Jonesy’s eyes widened. He hadn’t farmed up any
        knowledge on the topic! No amount of builds or impulse grenades would get him out of this one.
        <br>
        As Jonesy sat there, trying to string together a few sentences, Miloslurp watched. Jonesy was running out of
        time, and the pressure was on. Miloslurp gave him a warning look, like the storm was about to deal that final
        bit of damage.
        <br>
        And then, Jonesy dropped the ball. Instead of finishing the test, he scrawled out a weak answer, hoping for a
        clutch. He tried to escape the classroom with a Rift-to-Go, but Miloslurp caught him mid-portal.
        <br>
        “I don’t think so,” Miloslurp said. “You didn’t put in the work, and in this classroom, you don’t get a respawn.
        You’re staying behind.”
        <br>
        Jonesy Janas had lost his last round. He’d been outplayed, outgunned by the one teacher who didn’t miss a shot.
        As the bell rang, Jonesy knew he’d be back next season—this time, with a bit more grind.
        <br>
        Miloslurp watched him leave, then turned to his class, whispering, “That’s why you always aim for the head.”
